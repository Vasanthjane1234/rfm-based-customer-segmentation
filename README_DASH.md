## Usage Tips

1. **Start with All Data**: Begin with all filters set to "All" to see the complete picture
2. **Use Filters Strategically**: Combine filters to drill down into specific customer groups
3. **Explore Interactions**: Hover over charts for detailed information
4. **Check Summary Cards**: Monitor how filters affect key metrics
5. **Use Data Table**: Enable raw data view for detailed analysis

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port Already in Use**
   ```bash
   # Change port in dash_dashboard.py
   app.run_server(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0', port=8051)
   ```

2. **Missing Data File**
   - Ensure `rfm_segments_output.csv` exists
   - Run the Jupyter notebook first if needed

3. **Import Errors**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Performance Issues**
   - Close other applications
   - Reduce data size if needed
   - Use filters to limit displayed data

## Next Steps

- **Deployment**: Consider deploying to cloud platforms
- **Customization**: Add more chart types or metrics
- **Integration**: Connect to live data sources
- **Export**: Add data export functionality

---

**Note**: This dashboard requires the `rfm_segments_output.csv` file generated by the Jupyter notebook analysis.
